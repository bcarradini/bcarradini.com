Hi, I'm Barbara Carradini. I'm a highly productive, adaptable, and multi-skilled software engineer with a diverse array of technical and management experience, including software development, project management, system and process administration, and technical documentation. I've made a career out of picking up new skills on the fly. **I like to get shit done.**

I love clean, orderly, modular code. Building from scratch is perhaps the most fun, but I also have an editor's itch and am comfortable diving into, understanding, and cleaning up existing code bases.

But I don't just care about the code. Good software serves its audience, not just its engineers. Whether designing a simple business website or a complex application, I am committed to understanding and addressing the needs of the target audience and helping to ensure an excellent end user experience.
